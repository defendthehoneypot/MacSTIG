# Mac STIG for pentesting

This STIG comes from http://iasecontent.disa.mil/stigs/zip/U_Apple_OS_X_10-11_V1R4_STIG.zip and is used to lock down Macs.  I 
included a comment for each item to help explain what each item does.  The script requires two additional files, PolicyBanner.rtf and banner to create a login and ssh banner.

Modify banner and PolicyBanner.rtf and replace <Insert Company Name Here> with your organization name.
